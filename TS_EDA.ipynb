    "Since April of 2016, I've made (almost) monthly playlists on Spotify consisting of the songs I enjoyed listening to that month. I created them as the month went on, meaning they've got a couple of cool characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* They can be used to see which artist/genres I was listening to together at any given time\n",
    "* They provide point-in-time stats rather than the short-term, medium-term, and long-term song histories directly available from the API \n",
    "* They can more accurately be used to determine songs I particularly liked than looking at the songs I listened to frequently, and compared to the songs I listened to that didn't end up on a playlist (read: content-based recommendation system)\n",
    "\n",
    "I've gone through and pulled the data from all the playlists, grabbing the typical metadata on each song (see the [Spotify Documentation on audio features](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/operations/get-audio-features) for a full list and descriptions) including artist name, genre, release year, valence, tempo, key, etc. I was able to use the name of the playlist itself, dated almost uniformly throughout the past 6 years, to grab the month and year I listened to the song. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the analysis below, I mostly focus on either month trends for all years, or trends over the past 6 years rather than analyzing the data as a whole. "
